<p class="p1"><b>Color Theory</b></p>
<p class="p2">In the visual arts, color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color. A tradition of "colory theory" began in the 18th century, initially within a partisan controversy around Isaac Newton's theory of color (<i>Opticks</i>, 1704) and the nature of primary colors. From there it developed as an independent artistic tradition with only superficial reference to colorimetry and vision science.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Foundations</b></p>
<p class="p2">The most important problem has been a confusion between the behavior of light mixtures, called <i>additive</i> color, and the behavior of paint, ink, dye, or pigment mixtures, called <i>subtractive</i> color. This problem arises because the absorption of light by material substances follows different rules from the perception of light by the eye.</p>
<p class="p2">A second problem has been the failure to describe the very important effects of strong luminance (lightness) contrasts in the appearance of colors reflected from a surface (such as paints or inks) as opposed to colors of light.</p>
<p class="p2">Color theory was originally formulated in terms of three "primary" or "primitive" colors -- red, yellow and blue (RYB) -- because these colors were believed capable of mixing all other colors. This color mixing behavior had long been known to printers, dyers and painters, but these trades preferred pure pigments to primary color mixtures, because the mixtures were too dull (unsaturated).</p>

<p class="p2">Subsequently, German and English scientists established in the late 19th century that color perception is best described in terms of a different set of primary colors -- <b>red, green and blue violet (RGB)</b> -- modeled through the additive mixture of three monochromatic lights.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Complementary Colors</b></p>
<p class="p2">According to traditional color theory based on subtractive primary colors and the RYB color model, which is derived from paint mixtures, yellow mixed with violet, orange mixed with blue, or red mixed with green produces an equivalent gray and are the painter's complementary colors. These contrasts form the basis of Chevreul's law of color contrast: colors that appear together will be altered as if mixed with the complementary color of the other color. Thus, a piece of yellow fabric placed on a blue background will appear tinted orange, because orange is the complementary color to blue.</p>
<p class="p2">However, when complementary colors are chosen based on definition by light mixture, they are not the same as the artists' primary colors. This discrepancy becomes important when color theory is applied across media. <i>Digital color management uses a hue circle</i> defined around the additive primary colors (the RGB color model), as the colors in a computer monitor are additive mixtures of light, not subtractive mixtures of paints.</p>
<p class="p3"><b>Tints and Shades</b></p>
<p class="p2">When mixing colored light (additive color models), the achromatic mixture of spectrally balanced red, green and blue (RGB) is always white, not gray or black. When we mix colorants, such as the pigments in paint mixtures, a color is produced which is always darker and lower in chroma, or saturation, than the parent colors. This moves the mixed color toward a neutral color -- a gray or near-black. Lights are made brighter or dimmer by adjusting their brightness, or energy level; in painting, lightness is adjusted through mixture with white, black or a color's complement.</p>

<p class="p3"><b>Color Harmony</b></p>
<p class="p2">It has been suggested that "Colors seen together to produce a pleasing affective response are said to be in harmony." However, color harmony is a complex notion because human responses to color are both affective and cognitive, involving emotional response and judgement. Hence, our responses to color and the notion of color harmony is open to the influence of a range of different factors. These factors include individual differences (such as age, gender, personal preference, affective state, etc.) as well as cultural, sub-cultural and socially-based differences which gives rise to conditioning and learned responses about color.</p>

<p class="p2">Color wheel models have often been used as a basis for color combination principles or guidelines and for defining relationships between colors. Some theorists and artists believe juxtapositions of complementary color will produce strong contrast, a sense of visual tension as well as "color harmony"; while others believe juxtapositions of analogous colors will elicit positive aesthetic response. Color combination guidelines suggest that colors next to each other on the color wheel model (analogous colors) tend to produce a single-hued or monochromatic color experience and some theorists also refer to these as "simple harmonies."</p>
